[Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) has an intuitive API which mimics the language of an actual user. This library extends Capybara's finders and matchers with additional methods for interacting with tables, lists, and list items, as well as many HTML5 elements.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'capybara-extensions'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capybara-extensions

## Setup

A complete reference of the finders and matchers added by CapybaraExtensions is available at [Rubydoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/gems/capybara-extensions/frames). You can read more about the library in [this blog post](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2013/11/11/capybara-extensions.html).
